# Computer-Science-with-Google
Solutions for Computer Science with Android Fall 2016 Welcome to Applied Computer Science with Android! Description of Course: In this course, you will learn to practice various skills and concepts from undergraduate Computer Science curricula. In particular, we will revisit and implement concepts from Data Structures and Algorithms as well as Artificial Intelligence. We have chosen to use Android as a platform for development for two main reasons: its modern APIs and its easy-to-use graphical interface.  Each workshop will consist of larger programming exercises that students complete in pairs, with the support of facilitators in selected universities.
